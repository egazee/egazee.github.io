        <div class="panel">
            <p><span>egaze</span> is about creating a great and welcoming place for the people who join our server.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why did we choose the name <span>egaze</span>?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It's a long story. <span>egaze</span> was inherited from Eclipse and Stargaze. Eclipse and Stargaze are previous servers of the owner, which we decided to remake stargaze, but then the vanity was not available so we ultimately decided on gaze, but since we had a previous server called Eclipse, which was a network server we decided to merge the Eclipse server and the Stargaze server which ultimately became <span>egaze</span>. It's really a long story, but either way <span>egaze</span> is a completely original name. Some say <span>egaze</span> is like looking at something on the internet, but that's just how they describe it!</p>
